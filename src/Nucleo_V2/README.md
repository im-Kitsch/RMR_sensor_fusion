To test the SPI-funcionality you have to connect the following Pins onside the Nucleo Board.:

| SS   | SCK  | MISO | MOSI |        |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| PA4  | PA5  | PA6  | PA7  | Master |
| PA15 | PC10 | PC11 | PB2  | SLAVE  |



The Nucleo is Master AND Slave and talks to itself just for testing reasons.
